export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a sophomore student living in Naga City, with a deep passion for technology and gaming. As an aspiring developer, I am always eager to learn and grow my skills in web development and programming. My journey in tech started with a curiosity about how things work, and this curiosity has grown into a dedication to building functional, efficient, and user-friendly applications. 

I enjoy tackling complex problems and am particularly drawn to full-stack development, where I can explore both the front-end and back-end of web applications. My current focus is on learning modern tools and frameworks, such as React, Node.js, and MYSQL, and developing a deeper understanding of software architecture. 

When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll likely find me gaming, where I enjoy both the challenge and creativity that games provide. I also like to stay active and explore new technologies, keeping myself updated on industry trends. My goal is to continuously improve and contribute to the tech community, whether through personal projects, open-source contributions, or collaborations with other developers.`;
